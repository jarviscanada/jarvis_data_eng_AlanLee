# Alan Lee . Jarvis Consulting

I'm currently embracing the role of a software developer at Jarvis, where I continue to expand my technical skills and innovate within the tech industry. Prior to joining Jarvis, I served as a full-stack developer at a marketing analytics platform, where I gained substantial experience building applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). My academic journey in computer science at York University provided me with a strong foundation in software development, equipping me with the knowledge and skills to excel in my professional career.
What truly excites me about the software industry is its constant evolution and the capacity to drive significant improvements in quality of life through technology. I am deeply passionate about leveraging my skills to develop software solutions that are not only innovative but also accessible and impactful. The opportunity to tackle complex problems, contribute to meaningful projects, and continuously learn in this ever-changing field is what motivates me daily. My experiences, both academic and professional, have fueled my enthusiasm for making a positive difference through technology, and I look forward to contributing to transformative projects in my current and future roles.

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AlanLee/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Designed and implemented a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) designed to enable administrators to efficiently monitor and track CPU usage across each node within their Linux cluster. The primary goal is to ensure optimal resource allocation by providing administrators with the necessary insights to add or remove nodes based on usage data. This approach not only improves system performance but also ensures the cluster operates within its optimal capacity. The technology stack for this project includes Bash for scripting and automation tasks, which facilitates the efficient gathering and processing of CPU usage data across the cluster. Docker is utilized specifically for setting up a PostgreSQL (psql) database, which serves as a centralized repository for storing the CPU usage data collected from each node. This setup allows for robust data management and retrieval, enabling administrators to analyze trends and make data-driven decisions. Git is employed for version control, ensuring that the development and deployment of the project are smoothly managed, with the ability to track changes and collaborate effectively.


## Highlighted Projects
**Shopping Cart**: Engineered a full-stack web application leveraging Node.js for robust backend services and Angular for a dynamic frontend, supported by SQLite for database management, where I designed and deployed a comprehensive backend architecture to craft RESTful APIs for efficient management of product catalogs, shopping cart functionalities, and checkout procedures, while also enhancing user experience by developing intuitive shopping cart features and a seamless checkout flow for a responsive and interactive web interface.

**Sentiment Analyzer**: Developed a Python-based application to gather and analyze sentiment from similar apps on the Google Play Store, delivering valuable insights into user feedback, and utilized the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library for preprocessing each review, which enabled accurate sentiment analysis and facilitated the creation of a list of topics for each app.
